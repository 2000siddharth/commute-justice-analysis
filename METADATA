title: Python network preprocessing and routing optimization package

abstract: A collection of Python scripts that pre-process open street map, census and
DTED data to enable shortest route, slope (cost) and other network
analysis.

Using a combination of GDAL, shapely, networkx and possibly GRASS packages
to get nearest lines to points, project lines onto points, break lines at
intersections, remove dangles and other operations possible in QGIS, ArcGIS
and other GUI-based desktop applications, working to build a completely
automated and free system for doing some basic network analysis such
as routing optimization in Python.

description:  Beyond what is stated in the abstract above, this package
is developed to be able to assess the impact in total transportation costs, 
energy savings, carbon emission reductions in the use of terrain as a 
determinator of commuting patterns and then eventually compare that to 
alternative transportation including EVs, buses, etc.  This work is derived
from work done for the Army by Kyle Silver-Evans, John Matsumura, 
Endy Daehner
